# Review Questions

## What is Node.js?
A runtime enviornment that's capable of running JavaScript scripts
out of browser. Aswell as an enviornment to build servers. 

## What is Express?
Express is a very popular JavaScript framework that is
used for server side development.
 
## Mention two parts of Express that you learned about this week.
How express "listen"s for a client. The method is very similar to what
I've seen in python but it's very cool to see how it's done in express.

How to build a very basic sever API itself. I haven't ever seen
exactly how back end development flows but the lot I've learned in 
little time is fascinating.
## What is Middleware?
Software that bridges you're App to the DataBase. 

## What is a Resource?
Any peice of data within the API

## What can the API return to help clients know if a request was successful?
A status que can be sent back to the client to inform the client that
everything went smoothly.

## How can we partition our application into sub-applications?
With Routing. This allows instead of a giant index.js file, for individual
files for each "Chunk" of code that we need to define in the API.

## What is express.json() and why do we need it?
The 'express.json()' method is needed for parsing and building our
file that we use for a DataBase. Without it manually parsing and writing
a json file would be very time consuming.
